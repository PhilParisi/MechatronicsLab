# Mechatronics Lab
This repository was started in Fall 2022 to document code used in MCE433 (Mechatronics at the University of Rhode Island). Lab partners were Jason Noel and Phil Parisi. Parisi has continued work on this code and added to it over the years.

# Code Approach
The course built up to using a Python GUI to communicate with an Arduino via serial commands. All code was formulated around State Transition Diagrams (the 'switch' statements found on the Arduino). 

# Final Project
The final project was a wheeled robot (tank chassis) with two DC motors and a forward-looking ultrasonic sensor for object avoidance. To learn more, see the project report in the FinalProject folder.
